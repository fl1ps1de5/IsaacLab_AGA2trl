# Before I Begin, - A Warning!!!

The code that is present in this fork/repo, is not _production_ quality code... at least not at the moment. Changes have been made to various files, and the commit messages have not been super thoughtful. Also, there's a lot of bloat - i.e. files that aren't needed for the exact point of **my** project, and files that I created for my project that I never ended up using. 

That is true at least for the current moment in time (Nov 2024). 

That being said, the actual functionality of this code (particularly `es_trainer_complete.py` & `agda_run.py`) is proven (see bottom of read me), and works as intended. However, I have not documented exactly how the files should/can be used, and the actual functionality of the scripts depends on a workflow that is not setup to be automatic (i.e. some manual operations must be done before the files are usable). 

Anyways, looking to fix that at some point, but thought it was worth the warning...

# What is this?

This is a fork of [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). For details on what _that_ is, please check out the link.

# Why does it exist?

I created this fork to allow me to use IsaacLab to work on my undergraduate thesis - "A Study Into Approximate Gradient Descent Alternatives to Deep Reinforcement Learning".

# How did you use Isaac Lab in your thesis?

Well, because:

1. I want to brag
2. It's awesome
3. I'm lazy

, instead of actually writing in depth about what is going on here, I'll just include an excerpt from my thesis.
